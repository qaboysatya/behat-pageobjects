behat-pageobjects
=================

This is the repo to explain how the page objects can be implemented in behat for robust UI automation.

This repo assumes you have all setup behat and mink correctly.  Generally every project member who implements automated testing complains
about the Robustness of the UI automation.

So when Simon created of the Webdriver came up with Page object pattern http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects , this repo is all about implementing the same using behat and mink.
